This application provides the user with current and future weather details based on the specified city. Accuweather API is used to 
fetch the current weather details. The application also is able to provide details of weather for any given city in the world which
again is done by fetching city codes from accuweather and embedding it with weather API. In the query make sure to enter the city name 
and the time of the day or number of days for which weather report is required. For example: "Weather in Berlin today" will return weather 
details for today.The hits are restricted to 50 per day however it can be unlimited with a paid membership. Note that open weather API
is used to provide weather details for multiple days as accuweather has a  fee for same.
